Numpy Pandas Visualization Project Guidelines

•	Analyze the given dataset and apply Numpy, Pandas and Visualization functions you have studied and bring out the insights and storytelling for the same.
•	Please use Jupyter notebook to show the story telling.
•	Each Team would be given 20 minutes to present and 5 minutes for Q/A. (Please follow it strictly)

Note: Where ever possible provide priority to Seaborn and Plotly

Deliverables

Project statement. Based on the dataset, state a well-defined question that you’ll address in the project.

Preliminary Analysis: Explain your plans for preliminary data exploration. Please take care when specifying your plans, so that team members can work individually on these tasks if need be. If the data is clean, remove 10% of the data and try to impute values using forward or backward fill or by any other means. Justify your answer.

Detailed Analysis and Revised Project Statement: 4 - 5 slides revised project statement and Analysis using PPT and an accompanying Jupyter notebook (that was used to create the visuals).

Your 4 - 5 slide submission should include: - A description of the data: what type of data are you dealing with? What methods have you used to explore the data (initial explorations, data cleaning, etc)? Visualizations and captions/ interpretations that summarize the noteworthy findings of the analysis.

You are required to submit the following: - Jupyter notebook with relevant code (20 points) (Optional): A link to the project presented on a website/ blog / social media like medium, linkedin, etc.

Project Outcomes:
1.	Team work
2.	Understanding of all the concepts
3.	Data exploration and Analysis
4.	Visualizations using Python libraries
5.	Crisp presentation of the work done
